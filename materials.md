  ## Learning Materials

  ### Cheatsheets
  Useful for getting used to syntax
  - [Scalacheat | Scala Documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/cheatsheets/)
  - [Learn Scala in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/scala/)

  ### News
  Reading people talk about Scala is a great way to learn. I learned so much over the years by just reading reddit.
  - [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/scala)
  - [Scala Times](http://scalatimes.com/)

  ### Podcasts
  These are not Scala specific but they talk with people who write Scala or talk about general functional programming concepts.
  - [Lambda Cast](https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast)
  - [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/feed/mp3/)
  - [Co-Recursive](https://corecursive.com/)

  ### Blogs - Tutorials
  Handy sources to help you when you think "how can I do X?"
  - [The Neophyte's Guide to Scala - Daniel Westheide](https://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html)
  - [Alvin Alexander](https://alvinalexander.com/)

  ### Books
  Underscore books are super easy to just pickup and go. FP in Scala (red book) is recommended if you want some challange.
